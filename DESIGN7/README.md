Why This Layout Works
1. Content-First Architecture

All content is extracted from the official PHP 8.5 announcement
Semantic HTML5 structure ensures maintainability
No framework dependencies—pure HTML/CSS with minimal vanilla JS

2. Mobile-First & Performance

System fonts (-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, Segoe UI) for instant loading
CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive layouts without media query complexity
Single-file delivery with inline styles (no external dependencies)
Minimal JavaScript (only scroll progress and smooth scrolling)

3. Localization-Ready

No text in images or decorative elements
All content is plain HTML text
CSS custom properties for easy theme adaptation
Flexible grid systems that work with any language length

4. On-Brand for PHP.net

Official PHP purple (#777BB3) as primary color
Professional gradient accents that feel modern without being flashy
Clean typography hierarchy matching PHP.net's documentation style
Subtle grid background references PHP.net's technical nature

5. "WOW" Factor Balance

Gradient backgrounds and smooth transitions for visual interest
Animated scroll progress bar provides engagement
Hover effects on cards create interactivity
Code comparison sections with clear before/after contrast
Color-coded syntax highlighting makes code instantly readable

6. Code Comparison Excellence

Side-by-side layout on desktop, stacked on mobile
Visual labels ("Before 8.5" vs "PHP 8.5") with color coding
Proper syntax highlighting with distinct colors for keywords, strings, functions, etc.
Scrollable code blocks with styled scrollbars
Each feature has its own dedicated comparison section

7. Maintainability

Clear CSS variable system for colors and spacing
