âœ… Design Rationale
Layout Philosophy:

- Simple & Lightweight: Pure HTML/CSS, single JavaScript function (scroll progress only)
- Mobile-First: Responsive grid layouts that adapt from 1-column (mobile) to 2-column (desktop)
- Content-First: All text in semantic HTML, no images for decorative elements
- Localizable: System fonts, flexible containers, no hardcoded widths

Performance:

- System font stack (no web font downloads)
- CSS Grids
