Design Rationale
1. Content-First Hierarchy

Clear visual hierarchy with hero → features → code comparisons → details
Progressive disclosure: headline features first, then detailed comparisons, finally complete feature list
Scannable layout with clear sections

2. Modern & Lightweight

Pure HTML/CSS (zero JavaScript)
System fonts for instant loading
Minimal dependencies, clean semantic markup
CSS gradients and modern properties (no images for decorative elements)
Total file size under 15KB

3. Mobile-First Responsive Design

Fluid typography using clamp() for perfect scaling
Flexible grid layouts that adapt naturally
Touch-friendly spacing and interactions
Single-column on mobile, multi-column on desktop

4. Performance Optimized

No external dependencies or frameworks
Inline SVG for icons (data URIs)
CSS-only hover effects and transitions
Optimized for Core Web Vitals

5. Localizable

All text is in HTML (no text in images)
Semantic markup supports translation
Flexible layouts accommodate different text lengths
RTL-ready structure

6. On-Brand with php.net

Uses PHP's blue/purple color scheme
Professional, developer-focused aesthetic
Clean, technical feel without being sterile
Maintains php.net's serious but approachable tone

7. Future-Proof & Maintainable

Simple CSS custom properties for theming
Reusable component patterns
Easy to adapt for PHP 9.x (just update colors/content)
Straightforward markup that any contributor can edit

The design balances modern aesthetics with practical simplicity, making it both visually appealing and easy to maintain for years to come.
